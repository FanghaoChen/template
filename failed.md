### failed projects 

Just a note on projects that I put some serious effort in but didn't work out. I think it's good for us to make this process more transparent. This is along the same line as Johannes Haushofer's [CV of failures](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf) (which was inspired by a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a) by Melanie Stefan) and Ben Olken's [epic failures](https://economics.mit.edu/files/18768) with the exception that mines are not nearly as epic.

<ins>Does double counting (partially) explain illusotry truth effect (ITE)?</ins>
Illusory truth effect is a very robust result that shows repeated exposure to a statement makes people think it's more true, regardless of whether the statement is true or not. The leading explanation is that people use familiarity as a proxy for truth, and repeated exposure increases familiarity hence increases perceived truthfulness. But information might also play a role here? Suppose a listener hear the same statement from two different sources (can think of them as independent signals), then a Bayesian listen should rationally update her belief towards the direction of the statement? In standard ITE experiments the repetition doesn't provide any addtional information, but maybe the subjects think they do? Maybe they are double counting? So to test this I ran a very simple experiment on MTurk,
