### failed projects 

Just a note on projects that I put some serious effort in but didn't work out. I think it's good for us to make this process more transparent. This is along the same line as Johannes Haushofer's [CV of failures](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf) (which was inspired by a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a) by Melanie Stefan) and Ben Olken's [epic failures](https://economics.mit.edu/files/18768) with the exception that mines are not nearly as epic.
