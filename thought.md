### thought

Just some random thoughts on what I've been reading and thinking, not much at the moment, more coming soon.

<ins>On knowing and doing</ins>
It's interesting that as kids we tend to do a bunch of random and stupid stuff just to try things out, just like when we are running a randomized experiment where doing precedes and causes learning. But as we grow we tend to have a strong prior on many things so the value of experimentation decreases, we do what we think is the best, where knowing precedes doing. I really like what [Celeste Kidd](https://www.kiddlab.com/) said in her NeurIPS 2019 talk on ["how to know"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvebjL48f-w), "it is what you think you know that determines your curiosity, not what you actually don't know, if you think you know the answer, you are not curious to check it so you don't, and you get stuck with the wrong answer. People don't have a good model of their own uncertainty."
