<ins>**Targeting for Long-term Outcomes**</ins> [<a href="">paper</a>][<a href=" ">slides</a>]<br/>

<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the optimization of a targeting policy when the primary outcome of interest is observed only in the long-term. We build on statistical surrogacy and off-policy learning literature to impute the missing long-term outcomes with a surrogate index and learn the optimal targeting policy on the imputed outcomes via a doubly-robust approach. We validate our approach by comparing it with a policy learned on the ground truth long-term outcomes and show that they are statistically indistinguishable. Our approach also outperforms a policy learned on a short-term proxy for the long-term outcome. We use our method to target optimal discounts to the digital subscribers at the Boston Globe to maximize their long-term revenue. We implement the optimal targeting policy via bootstrapped Thompson sampling, which allows us to update the optimal policy for each new cohort of customers to account for non-stationarities in the environment. Over three years, our approach had a net-positive revenue impact in the range of $4-5 million compared to the status quo.

Abstract: TikTok is the most popular short video platform in the world with over 500M active users. We show three sets of early results using a unique dataset with detailed information on influencer created advertising videos, user engagement with the video (e.g., like, comment and share) and product page visits and sales on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) : (1) by exploiting the differential timing of video posting, we use a difference in difference approach to estimate the causal effect of influencer advertising on product page visits and sales and calculate influencer ROI, (2) we use methods in computer vision to extract feature embeddings from the videos and show that video content and influencer fixed effect explains about the same amount of variation in sales, (3) somewhat surprisingly, user engagement with the video is not predictive of sales, it suggests that it might not be a good idea for brands to choose influencers based on past engagement if they want to generate short-term sales.

Abstract: We investigate how uncertainty affects information sharing behavior. Using data on the spread of scientific news regarding the discovery of Higgs boson on Twitter in July 2012 we find that: (1) the main effect of uncertainty reduction on sharing probability is positive, (2) there's positive peer effect (crowding in) in the pre announcement or rumor phase that is characterized by piecemeal release of signals that are informative but noisy (high to medium uncertainty), (3) peer effect becomes negative (crowding out) in the post-announcement phase when the discovery is officially confirmed (low uncertainty) and (4) because of the negative interaction between information uncertainty and peer effect, when the number of sharing peers exceed some threshold, individuals are more likely to share when uncertainty is higher. This result suggests that the crowding in effect in rumor phase tends to amplify diffusion while the crowding out effect after confirmation tends to suppress diffusion. This motivates a simple learning model that highlights the mechanism through which uncertainty interacts with peer effects to drive the pattern of diffusion and offers a potential explanation to why rumors tend to diffuse wider and faster than verified news, even when the content of information is holding fixed. We further corroborate the result by analyzing a broader dataset that contains over 2400 rumors about 5 breaking news on Twitter from 2014-2015.
