<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper develops a framework for learning and implementing optimal targeting policies via a sequence of adaptive experiments to maximize long-term customer outcomes. Our framework builds on literature on doubly robust off-policy evaluation and optimization, and can also adapt to potential changes in the environment. We apply our framework to learn optimal discount targeting policies to the current subscribers at Boston Globe to maximize long-term revenue. Since the long-term revenue is not observable, we use intermediate outcomes such as subscribers' short-term revenue and their content consumption to construct a surrogate index and use it to impute the missing long-term revenues. We validate this surrogate index approach by comparing it with a policy learned on ground truth outcomes and show they are similar. Our method improves the average 1.5-year revenue by \$15 and projected 3-year revenue by $40 per subscriber compared to several baseline policies such as a policy that targets no one, a random policy, and a policy that targets subscribers with the highest churn risk. It also outperforms policies learned using outcome modeling and causal forest. Over a three year period, our approach has a net-positive revenue impact in the range of $1.7-$2.8 million compared to the status quo.

Abstract: TikTok is the most popular short video platform in the world with over 500M active users. We show three sets of early results using a unique dataset with detailed information on influencer created advertising videos, user engagement with the video (e.g., like, comment and share) and product page visits and sales on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) : (1) by exploiting the differential timing of video posting, we use a difference in difference approach to estimate the causal effect of influencer advertising on product page visits and sales and calculate influencer ROI, (2) we use methods in computer vision to extract feature embeddings from the videos and show that video content and influencer fixed effect explains about the same amount of variation in sales, (3) somewhat surprisingly, user engagement with the video is not predictive of sales, it suggests that it might not be a good idea for brands to choose influencers based on past engagement if they want to generate short-term sales.

Abstract: We investigate how uncertainty affects information sharing behavior. Using data on the spread of scientific news regarding the discovery of Higgs boson on Twitter in July 2012 we find that: (1) the main effect of uncertainty reduction on sharing probability is positive, (2) there's positive peer effect (crowding in) in the pre announcement or rumor phase that is characterized by piecemeal release of signals that are informative but noisy (high to medium uncertainty), (3) peer effect becomes negative (crowding out) in the post-announcement phase when the discovery is officially confirmed (low uncertainty) and (4) because of the negative interaction between information uncertainty and peer effect, when the number of sharing peers exceed some threshold, individuals are more likely to share when uncertainty is higher. This result suggests that the crowding in effect in rumor phase tends to amplify diffusion while the crowding out effect after confirmation tends to suppress diffusion. This motivates a simple learning model that highlights the mechanism through which uncertainty interacts with peer effects to drive the pattern of diffusion and offers a potential explanation to why rumors tend to diffuse wider and faster than verified news, even when the content of information is holding fixed. We further corroborate the result by analyzing a broader dataset that contains over 2400 rumors about 5 breaking news on Twitter from 2014-2015.
