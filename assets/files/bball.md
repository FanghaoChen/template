### transitivity in basketball games

We are looking at how transitive is the competition relationship between different NBA teams over time. 

By transitive we mean if team A beats team B most of the time, and team B beats team C most of the time, is it true that team A also beats team C most of the time? To put it another way, is there a clear hierarchy or it's more like a rock-paper-scissors type of power dynamics?

Some results coming soon.
