I’m trained as a convex combination of applied econometrician and data scientist with the weight changing between 0 and 1 depending on who I talk to. My current research leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, map, network) and combines tools in causal inference (both experimental and observational) and machine learning to optimize marketing decisions. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles.

<!--One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles. -->

I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Sinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) (co-chair), [Juanjuan Zhang](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/juanjuan-zhang) (co-chair) and [Dean Eckles](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/dean-eckles). Yes, pun intended.

Previously I studied business administration, economics and statistics at University of International Business and Economics and New York University. I've also worked in consulting as a business analyst intern.
