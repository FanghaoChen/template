I’m somewhat a convex combination of an economist and data scientist with the weight varying between 0 and 1 depending on the problem. 

My current research focuses on optimizing marketing decisions (e.g., advertising, targeting, pricing) with algorithmic products that turn unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) into actionable insights. The solutions we propose are typically motivated by basic microeconomic and psychological principles and implemented with the state-of-the-art techniques in causal inference (both observational and experimental) and machine learning (e.g., computer vision, reinforcement learning). I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors that feed into and are also influenced by these algorithmic products.

<!--My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles. -->

I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Sinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) (co-chair), [Juanjuan Zhang](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/juanjuan-zhang) (co-chair) and [Dean Eckles](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/dean-eckles). Yes, pun intended. Outside of MIT, I'm lucky to be working with [Vishal Singh](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/vsingh/index.html) (NYU Stern School of Business) and [Paramveer Dhillon](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/paramveer-dhillon) (University of Michigan School of Information). I'm also affiliated with the [Initiative on the Digital Economy](http://ide.mit.edu), [Social Analytics Lab](https://www.sinanaral.io/research/lab) and [Behavioral Research Lab](https://brl.mit.edu).

Previously I studied economics, management, and statistics at the University of International Business and Economics and New York University. I also worked in consulting as a business analyst.
