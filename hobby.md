### Hobby

<!---
I enjoy playing and watching sports, I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time and am currenlty at the level of 4.0 (self-rated). I also play intramural basketball and soccer with my friends in Sloan and GCF (Graduate Christian Fellowship). I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a few side projects related to [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) and basketball.

I also like reading and debating about philosophy and theology (particularly Apologetics and Calvinism). As a fun fact, I've lived in a church in South Korea to study the Bible and been on a mission trip to South Africa.
