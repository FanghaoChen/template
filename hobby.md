### Hobby

I enjoy playing and watching sports, I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time and am currenlty at the level of 4.0 (self-rated). I also play intramural basketball and soccer with my friends at Sloan and GCF (Graduate Christian Fellowship).

I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a few side projects related to tennis and basketball.
