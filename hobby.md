### hobby

I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially tennis, basketball, soccer and skiiing (for the long New England winters). I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time and am always looking for some hitting partners. I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a few side projects using [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) and [basketball](/assets/files/bball.md) data.

I also like reading and debating about literature, philosophy and theology (particularly [Apologetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics) and [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism)). As a fun fact, I lived in a church in South Korea and went on a mission trip to South Africa after college.

I like singing too, here's an excerpt of my covering of [Trace (轨迹)](/assets/files/179LincolnSt4.m4a) by Jay Chou. And here's some awesome video games that I've been playing lately: [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice) and [Nioh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nioh). These games are all very challenging and can be quite frustrating to play, but they are also massively satisfying when I beat them. It resembles the process of doing research.
