### Hobby

I enjoy playing and watching sports, I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time. I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a few side projects using data from [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) and [basketball]((/assets/files/bball.txt)). If you have any interesting questions or data that's related, definitely reach out to me. 

I also like reading and debating about literature, philosophy and theology (particularly Apologetics and Calvinism). As a fun fact, I've lived in a church in South Korea to study the Bible and been on a mission trip to South Africa. 

I also like singing, here's me covering a song named [Trace (轨迹)](/assets/files/179LincolnSt4.m4a) by Jay Chou.
