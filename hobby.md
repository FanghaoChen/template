### hobby

I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially tennis, basketball and soccer. I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time. I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a few side projects using data from [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) and [basketball](/assets/files/bball.md).

I also like reading and debating about literature, philosophy and theology (particularly Apologetics and Calvinism). As a fun fact, I've lived in a church in South Korea and been on a mission trip to South Africa. 

I like singing too, here's an excerpt of my covering of [Trace (轨迹)](/assets/files/179LincolnSt4.m4a) by Jay Chou. And here's some awedome video games that I've played recently [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice) and [Nioh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nioh).
